# Customer-Segmentation using K-means 
The primary aim of this project is to segment a customer base into distinct groups using the K-means clustering algorithm.

**Overview**
The Customer Segmentation using the K-means project aims to group customers into distinct segments based on their purchasing behavior, preferences, and other relevant attributes. By applying the K-means clustering algorithm, this project identifies patterns and similarities within the customer dataset, enabling businesses to better understand their customer base and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.

**Dataset Used**-The Dataset used is Mall Customer data ( attached in the repo)

**Features**
-K-means Clustering: Utilize the K-means algorithm to partition customers into clusters based on similarities in their feature space.
-Feature Selection: Choose relevant features such as purchase frequency, total spending, demographics, etc., for customer segmentation.
-Elbow Method for Optimal K: Determine the optimal number of clusters (K) using the Elbow Method or other suitable techniques.

-Interpretation of Clusters: Analyze the characteristics of each cluster to gain insights into customer segments and their distinguishing attributes.
-Visualization: Visualize the clusters using a scatter plot.
